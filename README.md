# Paduino
Arduino pad, just like steamdeck but bushcraft.
- Actually not working or incomplete.
- It has two programs in it:
  - The arduino client, which just receives the display menu and sends keypresses.
  - The python server, which executes everythin else.
- Main idea is to craft a steamdeck-like with a 3d printer and crappy code.
 
This project was made out of boredom, and will be continued once the boredom comes back, too busy for this stuff.
